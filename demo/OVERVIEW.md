//Sisonke â€“ Money Made Easy

```

## ðŸš€ Summary

```c
/*
Sisonke is a non-bank digital wallet and USSD-based payment ecosystem
created to serve informal businesses and unbanked communities, giving them
access to safe, affordable, and cashless transactions without relying on
traditional banks.

The platform enables informal traders (spaza shops, street vendors, tuck shops)
to accept digital payments via QR codes or USSD, reducing their dependence on
physical cash while opening opportunities for growth and financial inclusion.

Transactions are powered by stablecoins pegged to the South African Rand
(ZARToken), ensuring instant, low-cost, and stable transfers.

While the primary focus is on informal businesses and unbanked adults, Sisonke
also supports students under 16 through simple wallets that encourage early
financial literacy and allow them to make digital payments at schools or
community vendors.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

Inspiration Behind Sisonke â€“ Money Made Easy
--------------------------------------------

The majority of South Africans still depend heavily on cash, especially
informal businesses such as spaza shops, street vendors, and school tuck shops.
Cash dependency exposes traders to theft, lack of savings records, and limited
access to digital opportunities.

At the same time, millions of unbanked adults are excluded from the formal
financial system because of high bank fees, lack of documentation, or a deep
distrust of traditional banks. This keeps them locked out of digital commerce
and prevents growth in the informal sector.

Sisonke was inspired by the need to give these communities "digital dignity" â€”
the ability to transact, save, and grow using simple, accessible, and affordable
tools. By combining blockchain-based stablecoins with a USSD solution, we make
digital money available to anyone with a phone, not just those with a bank
account or expensive smartphone.

Students under 16 are also included as an additive layer, introducing financial
literacy and responsible money management at an early age, ensuring the next
generation grows up with the skills to thrive in a digital economy.
